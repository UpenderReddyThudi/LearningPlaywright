/*
In automation testing, API calls sometimes fail due to network issues.
 Write a JavaScript program that simulates retrying a failed API call using 
 a do...while loop. The program should retry a maximum of 5 times. Simulate 
 random success/failure using Math.random() (40% chance of success: 
 randomValue > 0.6). Log each attempt and print the final result.
