/*
As an SDET, you frequently need to generate test data for form testing. 
Write a JavaScript program that generates test user data using a for loop. 
Each user should have a unique ID (USR-0001 format), name, email, 
and role (cycling through: admin, editor, viewer, tester, manager).
 Every 3rd user should be inactive (edge case testing).Demonstrate proper 
 use of var (global counter), let (loop variables),and const (fixed values).
*/

const roles = ["Admin", "Editor", "Viewer", "Tester", "Manager"];

for (let i = 1; i<= users; i++) {
    let userid = "USR-000" + i;
    let username = `TestUser_${i}`;
    let email = `testuser${i}@testingacademy.com`;

    let role = roles[(i - 1) % roles.length];
    let status = (i % 3 === 0) ? "INACTIVE" : "ACTIVE";
